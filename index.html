  </header>

  <main>
    <p>YoVibe provides a platform for discovering and sharing the atmosphere at venues and events through short photos and ratings ("vibes"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information when you use the YoVibe mobile app or web services. YoVibe is intended for adults aged 18 and over.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope & Audience</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to information collected through the YoVibe app, website, and related services. By using YoVibe you confirm you are at least 18 years old. If you are under 18, do not use the service; access will be blocked by our age verification flow.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> email address, display name, profile photo.</li>
      <li><strong>User content:</strong> photos, captions, venue tags, timestamps, and any text you submit.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional:</strong> date of birth when provided as part of age verification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected & Technical Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers, OS version, app version, IP address, and performance/crash logs.</li>
      <li>Usage data: screens visited, features used, and analytics to improve the service.</li>
      <li>Location data: precise location only when you enable location permissions for features such as nearby venues and directions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Sensitive Data</h3>
    <p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive categories of personal information (e.g., racial/ethnic origin, health data). Do not submit sensitive data in photos or text.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Personal Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide core functionality: present venue information, display user-uploaded images, and enable discovery features.</li>
      <li>Moderation and safety: process reports, review content, and remove content that violates our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service.</li>
      <li>Communications: send service messages, updates, and optional marketing messages where you consent.</li>
      <li>Security and fraud prevention: detect and prevent abuse, maintain platform integrity.</li>
      <li>Analytics and improvement: measure and improve performance and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Legal Bases and Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Where applicable (for users in the EEA), we rely on legitimate interests, performance of a contract, or user consent depending on the processing. You may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or port your personal data; to object to processing; and to withdraw consent. Contact us to exercise these rights; we will respond in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>5. Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We share data only as necessary to provide services and with trusted providers under contract. Key categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cloud & storage:</strong> Firebase (Firestore, Storage, Authentication).</li>
      <li><strong>Maps & geocoding:</strong> Google Maps Platform (Places, Geocoding) when you use map features.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics & crash reporting:</strong> Google Analytics / Crashlytics or comparable providers.</li>
      <li><strong>Law enforcement & legal requests:</strong> when required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User-Generated Content & Moderation</h2>
    <p>Content you upload (photos, captions) may be visible to other users. We provide tools to report content and an admin moderation dashboard for review. Reports are stored in Firestore and evidence images in Firebase Storage. We use automated moderation signals and human reviewers; moderation logs may be retained for investigation and compliance.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. When you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize associated personal data within a reasonable timeframe, except where retention is required by law.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard safeguards to protect personal data in transit and at rest. Access to production data is limited to authorized personnel. However, no system is perfectly secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>9. Advertising and Third-Party SDKs</h2>
    <p>YoVibe does not target ads to children. If ads are shown, we will only integrate ad networks that comply with Google Play policies for adult-targeted apps and any applicable laws. Evaluate third-party SDKs for privacy compliance before integration.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be stored and processed in countries where our vendors operate (for example, Google Cloud). We will implement appropriate safeguards when transferring data across borders in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. Children & Minors</h2>
    <p>YoVibe is intended for persons 18 years and older and is not directed to minors. We do not knowingly collect personal data from persons under 18. If you believe a minor under 18 has created an account, contact us and we will promptly investigate and remove that account and related data as required.</p>

    <h2>12. Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
    <p>Our mobile app uses local storage (for example, AsyncStorage) to persist preferences and non-sensitive state. Server-side services may use cookies for web sessions. Review your device and browser settings to manage storage and cookies.</p>

    <h2>13. How to Exercise Rights & Contact</h2>
    <p>To exercise your privacy rights or request deletion of your personal data, email: <a href="mailto:privacy@yourcompany.example">privacy@yourcompany.example</a>. For support: <a href="https://yourcompany.example/support">https://yourcompany.example/support</a>.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy when necessary. We will post the updated policy with a revised effective date. For material changes we will provide notice via the app or email where feasible.</p>
