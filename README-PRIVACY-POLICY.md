# Privacy Policy files

These files were added so the `YoVibe-web` repository can host the app's privacy policy.

Files included:
- `privacy-policy.html`
- `privacy-policy.md`

To publish via GitHub Pages, ensure the Pages settings or workflow are configured and push these files to the `main` branch.
