  <h1>YoVibe — Account Deletion Request</h1>
  <p>This page explains how to request permanent deletion of your YoVibe account and personal data. You can host this page on a public HTTPS URL and reference it in the Google Play Console as the "Account deletion" contact page.</p>

  <h2>Quick in-app option</h2>
  <p>If you can open the YoVibe app: go to <strong>Settings &gt; Account &gt; Delete Account</strong> and follow the prompts. This deletes your account and associated data after verification.</p>

  <h2>Request deletion by email</h2>
  <p>If you cannot access the app, email us at <a href="mailto:reinolmartin0001@gmail.com">reinolmartin0001@gmail.com</a> with the subject line:</p>
  <pre>YoVibe Account Deletion Request</pre>
  <p>Please include the following information in the message to speed processing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The email address associated with your YoVibe account</li>
    <li>Your YoVibe user ID (if known)</li>
    <li>A short confirmation that you consent to permanent deletion</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What we will delete</h2>
  <p>When we process your deletion request we will delete:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your YoVibe account (authentication record)</li>
    <li>Your public profile information (display name, bio, profile photo)</li>
    <li>Content you created (posts, venues, events, vibe images) — where possible we remove media from storage</li>
    <li>User-specific metadata stored in Firestore linked to your account</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What may be retained</h2>
  <p>Certain data may be retained in limited form for legitimate business, legal, or security reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Backups and logs may be retained for up to 30 days to support recovery and abuse investigations.</li>
    <li>Aggregate or anonymized analytics data that cannot be tied back to an identifiable user may be retained indefinitely.</li>
    <li>Records required for legal compliance (e.g., tax or fraud investigations) may be retained as required by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Processing time</h2>
  <p>We will acknowledge your request within 5 business days and complete deletion within 30 calendar days where possible. If additional verification is required we will contact you at the email you provide.</p>

  <h2>Questions or disputes</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about the deletion process or need to dispute the outcome, email <a href="mailto:reinolmartin0001@gmail.com">reinolmartin0001@gmail.com</a>.</p>
